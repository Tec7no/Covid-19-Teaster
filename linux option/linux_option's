sympols for grep :
point (.) -> replace 1 character like A. in Ali 
result will be Al

(^) -> it will match start of string like file have :
Ali is There ?
No , Ali is out !
command : grep "^A" Test
output : Ali is There ? with red color on A !


(?) -> we use it with \ and it meaning the last character of word may be there or not like :
Ali
Al
now to use it write : grep -i "Ali\?" Test 

($) -> we use it to bring last character in line that match with our pattern like :

Ali is There ?
No , Ali is out !
Alih Aliasd Al

i will search about -> ? .

grep "?$" Test

i will get just one line and it is the first .
output : Ali is There ?

(*) -> we use it with -l options thx :) .

(+) -> more than reptation like if u want to get : AAAAAAAsadiam

grep "A\+s" Test
output : AAAAAAAsadiam
 
 !! u must write (\) to work !!
